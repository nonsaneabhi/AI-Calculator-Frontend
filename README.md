# Expression Evaluator and Drawer

This project allows users to **draw expressions on a canvas**, evaluate those expressions using the **Gemini API**, and display the results to the end user in a user-friendly interface. It combines intuitive design, robust functionality, and dynamically rendered mathematical expressions.
